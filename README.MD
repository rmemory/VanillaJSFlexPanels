This project contains examples of vanilla JS operations on a Flex CSS layout. 

It originates from and is largely based on a tutorial from Wes Bos.

This project demonstrates the following:

* Usage of FlexBox layouts in CSS.
* Lots of various kinds of CSS class selectors.
* Various transitions
* Handle subtle difference between Safari (arrogant bastards, and other browsers).
